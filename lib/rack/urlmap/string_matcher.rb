    # Rack::URLMap::StringMatcher encapsulates logic for for matching urls.
    #.
    # StringMatcher provides three main methods in the public interface:
    #
    # +priorities+:: to order matchers according to URLMap specs.
    # +matches?+:: to check if related mapping is applicable.
    # +rest+:: to get a 'wildcarded' part of the requested address.

      # of two elements, first one -- full match, second one -- capture group
      # (always string, maybe empty).
