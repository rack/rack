module Rack
  # Rack::URLMap takes a hash mapping urls or paths to apps, and
  # dispatches accordingly.  Support for HTTP/1.1 host names exists if
  # the URLs start with <tt>http://</tt> or <tt>https://</tt>.
  #
  # URLMap modifies the SCRIPT_NAME and PATH_INFO such that the part
  # relevant for dispatch is in the SCRIPT_NAME, and the rest in the
  # PATH_INFO.  This should be taken care of when you need to
  # reconstruct the URL in order to create links.
  #
  # URLMap dispatches in such a way that the longest paths are tried
  # first, since they are most specific.
