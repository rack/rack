module Rack

  # The Rack::Static middleware intercepts requests for static files
  # (javascript files, images, stylesheets, etc) based on the url prefixes or
  # route mappings passed in the options, and serves them using a Rack::File
  # object. This allows a Rack stack to serve both static and dynamic content.
  #
  # Examples:
  #
  # Serve all requests beginning with /media from the "media" folder located
  # in the current directory (ie media/*):
  #
  #     use Rack::Static, :urls => ["/media"]
  #
  # Serve all requests beginning with /css or /images from the folder "public"
  # in the current directory (ie public/css/* and public/images/*):
  #
  #     use Rack::Static, :urls => ["/css", "/images"], :root => "public"
  #
  # Serve all requests to / with "index.html" from the folder "public" in the
  # current directory (ie public/index.html):
  #
  #     use Rack::Static, :urls => {"/" => 'index.html'}, :root => 'public'
  #
  # Serve all requests normally from the folder "public" in the current
  # directory but uses index.html as default route for "/"
  #
  #     use Rack::Static, :urls => [""], :root => 'public', :index =>
  #     'public/index.html'
  #
  # Set a fixed Cache-Control header for all served files:
  #
  #     use Rack::Static, :root => 'public', :cache_control => 'public'
  #
