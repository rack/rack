# History/News Archive
Items below this line are from the previously maintained HISTORY.md and NEWS.md files.

## [2.0.0.rc1] 2016-05-06
- Rack::Session::Abstract::ID is deprecated. Please change to use Rack::Session::Abstract::Persisted

## [2.0.0.alpha] 2015-12-04
- First-party "SameSite" cookies. Browsers omit SameSite cookies from third-party requests, closing the door on many CSRF attacks.
- Pass `same_site: true` (or `:strict`) to enable: response.set_cookie 'foo', value: 'bar', same_site: true or `same_site: :lax` to use Lax enforcement: response.set_cookie 'foo', value: 'bar', same_site: :lax
- Based on version 7 of the Same-site Cookies internet draft:
	https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-first-party-cookies-07
- Thanks to Ben Toews (@mastahyeti) and Bob Long (@bobjflong) for updating to drafts 5 and 7.
- Add `Rack::Events` middleware for adding event based middleware: middleware that does not care about the response body, but only cares about doing work at particular points in the request / response lifecycle.
- Add `Rack::Request#authority` to calculate the authority under which the response is being made (this will be handy for h2 pushes).
- Add `Rack::Response::Helpers#cache_control` and `cache_control=`. Use this for setting cache control headers on your response objects.
- Add `Rack::Response::Helpers#etag` and `etag=`.  Use this for setting etag values on the response.
- Introduce `Rack::Response::Helpers#add_header` to add a value to a multi-valued response header. Implemented in terms of other `Response#*_header` methods, so it's available to any response-like class that includes the `Helpers` module.
- Add `Rack::Request#add_header` to match.
- `Rack::Session::Abstract::ID` IS DEPRECATED.  Please switch to `Rack::Session::Abstract::Persisted`. `Rack::Session::Abstract::Persisted` uses a request object rather than the `env` hash.
- Pull `ENV` access inside the request object in to a module.  This will help with legacy Request objects that are ENV based but don't want to inherit from Rack::Request
- Move most methods on the `Rack::Request` to a module `Rack::Request::Helpers` and use public API to get values from the request object.  This enables users to mix `Rack::Request::Helpers` in to their own objects so they can implement `(get|set|fetch|each)_header` as they see fit (for example a proxy object).
- Files and directories with + in the name are served correctly. Rather than unescaping paths like a form, we unescape with a URI parser using `Rack::Utils.unescape_path`. Fixes #265
- Tempfiles are automatically closed in the case that there were too
	many posted.
- Added methods for manipulating response headers that don't assume
	they're stored as a Hash. Response-like classes may include the
	Rack::Response::Helpers module if they define these methods:
    - Rack::Response#has_header?
	- Rack::Response#get_header
	- Rack::Response#set_header
	- Rack::Response#delete_header
- Introduce Util.get_byte_ranges that will parse the value of the HTTP_RANGE string passed to it without depending on the `env` hash. `byte_ranges` is deprecated in favor of this method.
- Change Session internals to use Request objects for looking up session information. This allows us to only allocate one request object when dealing with session objects (rather than doing it every time we need to manipulate cookies, etc).
- Add `Rack::Request#initialize_copy` so that the env is duped when the request gets duped.
- Added methods for manipulating request specific data.  This includes
	data set as CGI parameters, and just any arbitrary data the user wants
	to associate with a particular request.  New methods:
	 - Rack::Request#has_header?
	 - Rack::Request#get_header
	 - Rack::Request#fetch_header
	 - Rack::Request#each_header
