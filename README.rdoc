\Rack provides a minimal, modular, and adaptable interface for developing
web applications in Ruby. By wrapping HTTP requests and responses in
the simplest way possible, it unifies and distills the API for web
servers, web frameworks, and software in between (the so-called
middleware) into a single method call.

The exact details of this are described in the {\Rack specification}[https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/master/SPEC.rdoc],
which all \Rack applications should conform to.

== Supported web servers

The included *handlers* connect all kinds of web servers to \Rack:

* WEBrick[https://github.com/ruby/webrick]
* FCGI
* CGI
* SCGI
* LiteSpeed[https://www.litespeedtech.com/]
* Thin[https://rubygems.org/gems/thin]

These web servers include \Rack handlers in their distributions:

* Agoo[https://github.com/ohler55/agoo]
* Falcon[https://github.com/socketry/falcon]
* Iodine[https://github.com/boazsegev/iodine]
* {NGINX Unit}[https://unit.nginx.org/]
* {Phusion Passenger}[https://www.phusionpassenger.com/] (which is mod_rack for Apache and for nginx)
* Puma[https://puma.io/]
* Unicorn[https://yhbt.net/unicorn/]
* uWSGI[https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/]
* Lamby[https://lamby.custominktech.com] (for AWS Lambda)

Any valid \Rack app will run the same on all these handlers, without
changing anything.

== Supported web frameworks

These frameworks and many others support the \Rack API:

* Camping[http://www.ruby-camping.com/]
* Coset[http://leahneukirchen.org/repos/coset/]
* Hanami[https://hanamirb.org/]
* Padrino[http://padrinorb.com/]
* Ramaze[http://ramaze.net/]
* Roda[https://github.com/jeremyevans/roda]
* {Ruby on Rails}[https://rubyonrails.org/]
* Rum[https://github.com/leahneukirchen/rum]
* Sinatra[http://sinatrarb.com/]
* Utopia[https://github.com/socketry/utopia]
* WABuR[https://github.com/ohler55/wabur]

== Available middleware shipped with \Rack

Between the server and the framework, \Rack can be customized to your
applications needs using middleware. \Rack itself ships with the following
middleware:

* Rack::Chunked, for streaming responses using chunked encoding.
* Rack::CommonLogger, for creating Apache-style logfiles.
* Rack::ConditionalGet, for returning not modified responses when the response
  has not changed.
* Rack::Config, for modifying the environment before processing the request.
* Rack::ContentLength, for setting Content-Length header based on body size.
* Rack::ContentType, for setting default Content-Type header for responses.
* Rack::Deflater, for compressing responses with gzip.
* Rack::ETag, for setting ETag header on string bodies.
* Rack::Events, for providing easy hooks when a request is received
  and when the response is sent.
* Rack::Files, for serving static files.
* Rack::Head, for returning an empty body for HEAD requests.
* Rack::Lint, for checking conformance to the \Rack API.
* Rack::Lock, for serializing requests using a mutex.
* Rack::Logger, for setting a logger to handle logging errors.
* Rack::MethodOverride, for modifying the request method based on a submitted
  parameter.
* Rack::Recursive, for including data from other paths in the application,
  and for performing internal redirects.
* Rack::Reloader, for reloading files if they have been modified.
* Rack::Runtime, for including a response header with the time taken to
  process the request.
* Rack::Sendfile, for working with web servers that can use optimized
  file serving for file system paths.
* Rack::ShowException, for catching unhandled exceptions and
  presenting them in a nice and helpful way with clickable backtrace.
* Rack::ShowStatus, for using nice error pages for empty client error
  responses.
* Rack::Static, for more configurable serving of static files.
* Rack::TempfileReaper, for removing temporary files creating during a
  request.

All these components use the same interface, which is described in
detail in the \Rack specification.  These optional components can be
used in any way you wish.

== Convenience

If you want to develop outside of existing frameworks, implement your
own ones, or develop middleware, \Rack provides many helpers to create
\Rack applications quickly and without doing the same web stuff all
over:

* Rack::Request, which also provides query string parsing and
  multipart handling.
* Rack::Response, for convenient generation of HTTP replies and
  cookie handling.
* Rack::MockRequest and Rack::MockResponse for efficient and quick
  testing of \Rack application without real HTTP round-trips.
* Rack::Cascade, for trying additional \Rack applications if an
  application returns a not found or method not supported response.
* Rack::Directory, for serving files under a given directory, with
  directory indexes.
* Rack::MediaType, for parsing Content-Type headers.
* Rack::Mime, for determining Content-Type based on file extension.
* Rack::RewindableInput, for making any IO object rewindable, using
  a temporary file buffer.
* Rack::URLMap, to route to multiple applications inside the same process.

== rack-contrib

The plethora of useful middleware created the need for a project that
collects fresh \Rack middleware.  rack-contrib includes a variety of
add-on components for \Rack and it is easy to contribute new modules.

== rackup

rackup is a useful tool for running \Rack applications, which uses the
Rack::Builder DSL to configure middleware and build up applications
easily.

rackup automatically figures out the environment it is run in, and
runs your application as FastCGI, CGI, or WEBrick---all from the
same configuration.

== Quick start

Try the lobster!

Either with the embedded WEBrick starter:

    ruby -Ilib lib/rack/lobster.rb

Or with rackup:

    bin/rackup -Ilib example/lobster.ru

By default, the lobster is found at http://localhost:9292.

== Installing with RubyGems

A Gem of \Rack is available at {rubygems.org}[https://rubygems.org/gems/rack]. You can install it with:

    gem install rack

== Usage

You should require the library:

    require 'rack'

\Rack uses autoload to automatically load other files \Rack ships with on demand,
so you should not need require paths under +rack+.  If you require paths under
+rack+ without requiring +rack+ itself, things may not work correctly.

== Configuration

Several parameters can be modified on Rack::Utils to configure \Rack behaviour.

e.g:

    Rack::Utils.key_space_limit = 128

=== key_space_limit

The default number of bytes to allow all parameters keys in a given parameter hash to take up.
Does not affect nested parameter hashes, so doesn't actually prevent an attacker from using
more than this many bytes for parameter keys.

Defaults to 65536 characters.

=== param_depth_limit

The maximum amount of nesting allowed in parameters.
For example, if set to 3, this query string would be allowed:

    ?a[b][c]=d

but this query string would not be allowed:

    ?a[b][c][d]=e

Limiting the depth prevents a possible stack overflow when parsing parameters.

Defaults to 32.

=== multipart_part_limit

The maximum number of parts a request can contain.
Accepting too many part can lead to the server running out of file handles.

The default is 128, which means that a single request can't upload more than 128 files at once.

Set to 0 for no limit.

Can also be set via the +RACK_MULTIPART_PART_LIMIT+ environment variable.
